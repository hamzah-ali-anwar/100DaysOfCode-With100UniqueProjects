# Use bitwise AND (&) on 5 and 3.

'''1. Divide the number by 2:
   2. Write down the remainder (0 or 1).
   3. Use the quotient from the division as the new number.
   4. Continue this process until the quotient is 0.
   5. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order (from last to first).

result = 5 & 3
print(result)

print("_______")

result_two = 5 & 75
print(result_two)
