''' It's almost the Summer Sales!
 
# You work for a shop that wishes to give a discount of discount% to the most and least expensive item purchased by a given customer during the sales period. Only two products can benefit from the discount. 
#   You are tasked by the shop owner to implement the function calculateTotalPrice(prices, discount) which takes the list of prices of the products purchased by a customer and the percentage discount as parameters and returns the total purchase price as an integer (rounded down if the total is a float number).
 
#  Constraints:
#  0 ≤ discount ≤ 100
#  0 < price of a product < 100000
#  0 < number of products < 100 '''
